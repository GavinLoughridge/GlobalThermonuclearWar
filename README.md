## Global Thermonuclear War

Our team's capstone project for Galvanize Web Development Immersive program.

Global Thermonuclear War is a full-stack board game, played across multiple devices,
where you are an international power locked in an arms race with the rest of the world.
Our team wanted to build a game that took full advantage of technologies like mobile
devices, video projectors, and cameras while also having the in-person social
interaction of a traditional board game.
